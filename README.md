THE TRUTH IS HERE

In our school, we are restricted and spied on all the time. Do not be a wuss and delete your photos, face them without fear. What can they do? It is our iPad, that we wasted over half a grand on. Do not think the iPads are good, they're not. Do not let the fact that Joy will be inspecting delete all of your photos, they are making the next generation pussies, who cannot do anything and are made to work. No creativity and no imagination. The teachers who do not enforce classroom are the good ones, since they care about students privacy. Teachers who do enforce it, are bad teachers.

Wearing masks does not help with the virus, if one person in a class gets it, most likely the entire place will get it.

BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING ALL THE TIME: The teachers and principal are known for collecting data, and the code of behaviour cannot be found anywhere, it's likely in Joy's head.
